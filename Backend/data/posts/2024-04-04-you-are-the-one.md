_Inspired by “You are the one” by Plumm and the codex of love._

Special One,

What would I like to say to you, you ask? What else is there to tell? You are the one.

In my daydream, you were in my arms. The sun rays were bright and beautiful, with no pint of hostility. I slowly woke to my reality on my couch. I immediately sat up. Listless. I held my chest. My heart was still beating. You should have seen me heave a sigh of relief: I was still alive. It was as though I were breathing for you. I have canvassed my whole mind. You are the one I keep returning to. You are the one I will be revolving.

It has become difficult to feel; not that it’s an excuse. A thousand different sensory stimuli, all at the same time, is a lot to process. It’s easier to shut them all off. Everyone is reaching for a high. How do I keep my sensibilities from going numb? So, I get up and stretch out my hand to the world. I spin myself two or three times, with my hands still out. I don’t know what else to do. It’s not like I know what I am doing. Someone just shot me a look. Everyone seems unnecessarily complicated, including you. Or is it me? I will search my soul for you. I will find my way to you. Today, I tried to talk to my friend, but she wasn’t in the mood. Everyone is so easily irritated. What happened to sensitivity?

I sit here, and stare at my screen. I see nothing. I feel the thick concrete wall between us. It is difficult to be inspired. It’s difficult to feel your love. When you touch me, it’s as if you're wearing an inch thick sandpaper glove. Why does it feel so? Yeah, I am not confident that you know either. I know you have been out of sorts too, and I understand.  

I hope peace lies at the end for both of us. 

Yours Sincerely,
