_Isaiah 45:7 KJV_
_I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things._

Contrary to what you might believe, there was very little said about the entity called Satan before Jesus Christ. The conceptions of Satan across the Old and New Testaments of the Christian bible are so irreconcilably dissimilar that they might as well be two distinct entities. It is hard to overstate this fact: the Satans of both halves of the Christian bible are different in almost every aspect. The most important part of this dichotomy is his footprint in the life of God’s people. The post will lead you to ponder on this delicate topic and to draw your own informed conclusions. Beyond those conclusions, however, what we would really like to achieve is to orient the reader’s mind to take constructive action when confronted with adversity.

### The African Devil

This means that the 1000 things you know about the devil is probably from someone or popular culture.

Most of the things we know about this being, we learnt from others. Those others might have assimilated what they know from other people. Ultimately, teachings about Satan come from trusted personalities who hold a lot of credibility in our eyes. However, we must exercise caution when learning from them, and I will tell you why. 

Most people we trust to have an informed take about the Devil make their case based on their experiences and the perception of ‘spirituality’, both theirs and ours, which informs those experiences. Put bluntly, it is difficult to assess who is actually in tune with spiritual things, and to what extent they may be. Even if we accept spirituality as enough basis, one’s exaggerated self-importance might get in the way of a true assessment of their knowledge of spiritual matters. Especially in our setting, we must be careful not to mistake a person’s charisma for expertise. And since we cannot verify spiritual things empirically, we should tread carefully with such issues. 

In the philosophy of argumentation, substantiating one’s claims by using only the fact it is the word of a claimed spiritual authority is a logical fallacy called the appeal to authority.

### The original Devil is not fallen

In the King James version of the Christian bible, a quick search reveals that the word ’Satan’ appears fifteen (15) times. All mentions are properly, and with correct context, translated literally from the original Hebrew as ‘adversary’. In all those cases, they depict the idea of some adversary, not a particular one. Among these, in only two instances does Satan appear to be a being because of the addition of a definite article which makes it ‘ha’Satan’ or the Satan. The first is in the book of Job. You will find the second in the first two verses of the third chapter of the book of Zachariah.   

Let me furnish this with some context. The Christian religion came out of Judaism. This means all their scripture is sacred to us as well. This is what is called the Old Testament. And then there is the New Testament, which contains the core of the religion’s doctrine. As such, you will realise that the Jewish conception of Satan, which is born by the Old Testament, is vastly different from the entity in the New Testament. It is noteworthy that the two cannot be reconciled! Think about that for a second and draw your own conclusions. 

Contrary to what you might believe, there is very little said about the entity called Devil or Satan in the Bible. This has led to a plethora of ideas and beliefs, especially for African Christians.



Perhaps the most salient passage in the when it comes to Satan is the book of Job. 

We must not be quick to look outside of ourselves and our agency when we are confronted with adversity. This is by far the most important takeaway from this post.
