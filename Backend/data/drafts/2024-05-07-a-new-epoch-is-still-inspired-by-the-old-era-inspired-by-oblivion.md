Five years ago, I wrote a ‘poem’. Actual poets might deride me. So I ask any actual professionals who might be reading this to forgive me. As far as I can tell, there is nothing compelling about it from a literary perspective. It is not splendidly arranged. It has no rhyme scheme. But it is my proudest literary work yet. And yet, perhaps unsurprisingly, no one seems to love it like I do. This is okay. It seems this is the case with many artists and their fans: ironically, their sensibilities are usually orthogonal. 

This work is inspired by an instrumental piece of the same name by Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla. I first heard it when it was rendered on the acoustic guitar by Nadia Kossinskaja on YouTube. It was so beautiful, and deep and so haunting. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t remain still. It evoked such a deep sadness and pain; pain I hadn’t felt before. But this sort of pain didn’t ache too badly. It just felt like a dull, throbbing feeling of perpetual unrest. 

It also highlights a very important time in my life: a time when I was in a deep struggle with myself. I hope you will enjoy it. I hope you will derive meaning from it, and if not, share in my perpetual tango with my reality, at least. True to the meaning of the title, many times, the piece makes me painfully aware of forgetting: forgetting things and people, forgetting and losing yourself, and being forgotten. 


#### Inspired by OBLIVION
_Is it all worth it?_  
_I want lose myself_  
_I want to get drunk on my lust and rage_  
_I want to feel the soul of the Most High_  
_I want to sink like a stone beneath the lowest of the low in me_  
_I want to throw myself into oblivion_  

_It all feels meaningless_  
_It all seems not to matter_  
_Whether I live or die, it makes not a difference_  
_To the big beautiful universe, I am less than a blip_  
_Why it matters to me that I am a speck of dust_  
_Or that I’m the blinding sun is tomorrow’s tale_  

_My soul is torn and broken_  
_Its cloth ripped, its brittle bones collapsing beneath_  
_The weight of this world’s burden that it needlessly bears_  
_I want to plunge myself into the recesses of my troubled spirit_  
_To stand in the darkness that is me_  
_That we may be singular_  

_Star-bright God of gods_  
_He who wraps himself in energy_  
_He who is no he at all_  
_The world is thy playground and_  
_We are your animated dolls_  

_I extol you tonight_  
_If you will accept he who is not worthy_  
_I will lift you who is already Most High_  
_How about I lower you into_  
_The depth of the underworld which you formed_  
_Tell me Light of lights, Life of all that lives_  
_Are you the most low, the Most Depraved as well?_  

_Will you lend me your hand of power?_  
_The right arm that subdues and exults that_  
_I might fulfil my selfish desires_  
_Will you make me a mini-God pray tell_  
_That I might be you in here, or am I already?_  
_It doesn’t feel like that at all_  

_The mother cries because death claims his property_  
_That is her child who descends from her womb_  
_The man wails for lack of bread_  
_Despair claims the joy of hard work and_  
_You are left to wonder and gaze into the deep black darkness_  
_Is it all worth it?_  

WRITTEN by yours truly
