Dear Sol,

The elders speak of the Great Canvas in every soul: vast and mysterious. It stretches as far as the eye can see. It is deeper than any abyss you could imagine. No one knows what this canvas is made of. It is said the materials of its creation are otherworldly. And yet, we lowly humans are able etch on it our earthly artistry.

It is of this matter I write to you, my sun ray. Many moons have I pondered upon this fateful exchange. Along these lines, I approach cautiously with a proposition; one that is not as ghastly when you recover from your inevitable initial shock:  I would like to carve into your soul the outlines of my love. I admit this is perhaps too forward, very presumptuous even. You are a woman of great beauty, with intelligence that is even more supreme. You will no doubt wonder why I have boldly communicated an intent to hurt you. After all, an artist may not hurt himself while carving wood, but the wood will not come out unscathed. What, or who, has given me the audacity of a thousand fools, you ask? That I cannot say for certain, except that I might be the biggest one of the lot.  

I fear, however, that there is a terror in your heart’s land. I perceive a deep dread and an eerie silence from a place that should be a melting pot of candid expression. It is famed that, long ago, someone ventured into your beautiful forest and laid waste the pristine landscape curated by the Divine Authority himself. 

is said to have happened in those hinterlands I heard the  there is a deep in your heart river will wade through.

We forget that a fearsome predator just wants to survive as well. They must do what is necessary to earn the opportunity to continue breathing. I know the whole ordeal is terrifying for you as well. Even as we stare into the darkness in your soul, the darkness looks int us as well. So my dear
