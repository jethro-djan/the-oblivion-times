# About this project

This is the public repository for my online publication, The Oblivion Times. We will have more voices on there in the future but for now, I am the only who writes there.

# Technology stack

This project is also meant as a show-and-tell. It was previously written using Jekyll and Ruby. But I want a job in the .NET and React space so I am rewriting it to show proficiency with that stack.

I use simple TailwindCSS v4, React & React Router (with Vite as build tool) and out-of-the-box ASP.NET Core.
